LUTO II - Land-Use Trade-Offs modelling framework
=================================================

LUTO II is version two of the Land-Use Trade-Offs model. The model predicts future spatial land-use distributions based on a economic cost-minimisation logic under various constraints, including environmental limits.

The LUTO II modelling framework was developed at Deakin University by Fjalar de Haan, Brett Bryan and colleagues (see [CITATION.cff](CITATION.cff)). It it the product of the Land-Use Futures project which is a collaboration between ClimateWorks Australia, the CSIRO and Deakin University (see [luf@cwa](https://www.climateworksaustralia.org/project/land-use-futures/) and [luf@deakin](https://www.planet-a.earth/other-projects-1/e6xzzv5emwd7p9fsd8pxyluv4840iz)).



LUTO II is therefore an optimisation model with a linear programme at heart. To do the actual solving, the model interfaces with commercial solver GUROBI.

The original LUTO (i.e. LUTO I) was developed at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) between 201x and 201x and published under the GNU GPLv3 in 2021.
